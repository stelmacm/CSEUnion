The ElasticNet (ridge and lasso) regression is performed on the data set for predicting lossCost.
The categorical variables are converted to dummy variables.
Bussiness type has 32 levels, which is converted to 31 binary variables and one of levels is the reference category.
Province has 2 levels and has been converted to a binary variable.
City has about 6000 unique levels. Hence, I overlooked this variable as it also is reflected in latitude and longitude.
AmountofInsurance variable and also the regressand are normalized to the range of 0 and 1.
First, Lasso is fitted on data and 10-fold cross validation is performed for chooseing lambda. Then a range of 
alpha values have been tested and the best one is chosen based on 10-fold cross validation.
